November comes slowly to an end, and with it, the Yuletide season quickly approaches. I taught at [Splash (MIT's volunteer-taught cavalcade of classes for high-schoolers)](https://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/index.html) this year, teaching two courses: a class on quickly making ad hoc tabletop scenarios (you can find my course notes [here](../../fun.html)), and a workshop on cuneiform. Both went quit well.

Thanksgiving also went well; I enjoyed a time at a Professor's house, and went with several friends, bringing three pies, cranberry sauce, and creamed onions. A wonderful time was had by all. I have gone to this Professor's house each year, and at this point, I'm the primary pie-maker. We brought apple, pumpkin, and chocolate pecan pies (recipes for the latter [here](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/pumpkin-pie-recipe) and [here](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2010/11/24/holiday_organic_synthesis_chocolate_pecan_pie)), using my grandmother's crust recipe. I made a small modification to the crust, which calls for 1 teaspoon of vinegar - I replaced this with a half-teaspoon of vinegar and a half-teaspoon of calvados - the alcohol makes the crust easier to roll out, and both ingredients suppress gluten formation.

On to other items: In the course of researching for my Splash class, I did a lot of reading and found useful in particular articles from [The Alexandrian](http://thealexandrian.net/), a website which has many useful articles relating to scenario design, gamemastering, and tabletop games in general. A good find, and I heartily recommend it. In any case, this website led me to discover a much wider world of tabletop games, many of which I would definitely like to try out, in particular [Technoir](http://www.technoirrpg.com/), a cyberpunk game of "high-tech, hardboiled roleplaying." It uses a cool resolution system, and has some nice scenario design concepts at its heart that make it an attractive option for ad hoc play. I also enjoyed the post about [dice drop generators for cities](http://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/36625/roleplaying-games/check-this-out-city-generators) which connected me to some resources I'd never seen before.

Anyways, on to December, and soon, break. I have many final projects to complete before the sun sets on this semester, but when they're done, oh, how lovely the respite will be.
