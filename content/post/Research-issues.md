It's been a bit hard-going with my research work for my thesis. I've been working on building a [split-bottom flow cell](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/45909007_Granular_Flows_in_Split-Bottom_Geometries) for granular flow research; unfortunately, it's been rather difficult to install the glass beads on the sides of the walls with epoxy. Due to the curved surface, it's sort of tricky to coat the walls evenly. In addition, it's difficult to get the cell walls (a polycarbonate cylinder) to seat properly due to splotches of epoxy that thicken the walls in some places.

Moving forward, I'll be working on getting the cell fully assembled, and then installing the lighting and camera for image capture. I'll be using digital image correlation (DIC) to extract velocity fields from the image data, and getting some good data from my lab setup will be a big step forward.
