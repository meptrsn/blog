As the year comes to an end, consider what you can do in your community. Join school boards. Run for local and state offices. Write to your legislators. Talk to people. Educate them, and listen to them. There are deep divides between people in this country, and it's going to take a lot of work to bridge them and build a better consensus. 

To make this country become a better place despite the current circumstances, we need to talk to each other, talk to our legislators,and participate in government. We will only get through this together with mutual education and the execution of civic duties. It's not easy, and there are obstacles, but it is necessary.
